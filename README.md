# Sample Spring API Validation Project

> This project demonstrates some API validation patterns for Spring Boot Web Applications.

Accompanies my blog post: [Validating Requests in Spring Boot](https://marcdenning.com/posts/2020/02/11/validating-requests-in-spring-boot/).

## Getting started

The sample application is built with Gradle and uses the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to ensure a consistent build environment.
Build the Spring Boot application with the following command:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

## Technology in use

* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3
* Gradle
